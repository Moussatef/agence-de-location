            <h2>Car rental</h2>
            <p>Car rental companies are going through very difficult times. Bankruptcies of
                companies multiply and those which are still operational present an economic situation
                and very fragile accountant. The worst is to be feared, as there is no sign of an improvement in
                situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                A finding confirmed by representatives of the sector. After a difficult period during confinement
                 which lasted more than three months, the rental companies believed they saw the end of their ordeal. They banked on
                 summer vacations to be able to relaunch their businesses, but the ban on travel to and from
                 8 Moroccan cities - known for their economic, demographic and tourist potential -, a few
                 days before Aïd Al-Adha, took away all hope.

            <h2>Can I take the insurance directly from the rental agency?</h2>
            <p>
                I don't recommend it, you don't speak the same language and the world of insurance is really
                complicated. Do not bother with all this and know that it is cheaper to take all-inclusive insurance on
                the Carigami.fr site because they have signed agreements and since it is a very well-known site they
                manage to lower the prices ...

                Do not hesitate to check or uncheck these insurances, you will see that the amount will be increased by
                barely 25 € over 5 days, or 5 € / day.

                Here is what you must check to be insured even if you have a serious accident and even if you are at
                fault:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insurance without excess</li>
                <li>Tires / broken glass</li>
                <li>Underbody</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In short with this package you are insured in the event of damage, that is to say: Scratch, collision, blow
                 bodywork (even if it's your fault), theft protection, tire insurance, ice debris. <br>
                 In the event of a serious accident, you are also insured here. On the other hand you will have to advance the amount of
                 the excess which is 1400 € max. Subsequently, thanks to this insurance, you will be reimbursed in full
                 by the rentalcars provider, because it is through them that Carigami.fr passes.

            <h2>ALWAYS SAFE WITH OUR USED CAR: ROAD ASSISTANCE</h2>

            <p>

                count on roadside assistance for the duration of the warranty. The service is available 24
                hours a day, 365 days a year. *

                partners.</p>

            <h2>Insurance advice for renting your car?</h2>
            <p>You have read all over the forums that quite a few people have been fooled with car insurance. The
                problem is that the rental company wants to raise the bill and for that it tries to make you sign
                insurance contracts when you come to collect the rental vehicle.

                The system is well established, they know how to do it and if they can get you they will do it without
                any regrets.

                So your best bet is to take out all-inclusive insurance when booking your rental car.

                If there is a problem, you see that the rental company is trying to get you to sign other documents
                (such as insurance) do not hesitate to call Carigami.fr 01 73 79 33 33, they have the rental number and
                they will know how to calm them ... Also show them the voucher with the assurance that you have received
                by email (remember to print it). Carigami does a translation of the insurance you used in the language
                of the agency. </p>
            <h2>Advice on the civil liability of a car rental</h2>
            <p>
                If you select a car deal and see this red “€ 500,000 Liability” icon, that doesn't mean you aren't
                entitled to it. This is a warning because in France civil liability is € 1,000,000 and not €
                500,000, and then we are not going to lie to each other, it is also to attract the eye to take out
                their ALL-inclusive rental car insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short even if it is in red you are covered for 500,000 €, but frankly take everything included
                (it will cost you 5 € / day more and there you are 100% covered), there is no offer at of the. I'll
                let you compare, you will see that it is almost the same.
